# System Software Lab Practicals - GTU

This repository contains lab practicals for the subject **System Software** as per the Gujarat Technological University (GTU) curriculum. The programs are written in C language and cover essential compiler design concepts like lexical analysis, finite automata, left factoring, and removing left recursion.

## 🧪 Practicals Included

### ✅ Practical 1: Lexical Analyzer
**Description**:  
Implements a simple lexical analyzer for a subset of the C programming language. It identifies:
- Keywords
- Operators
- Identifiers
- Integers
- Real Numbers

**File**: `practical1_lexical_analyzer.c`

### ✅ Practical 2: Finite Automaton String Validity Checker
**Description**:  
Checks if a given string is accepted by a fixed finite automaton using hardcoded transitions.

**File**: `practical2_finite_automata.c`

--->>

### ✅ Practical 3: Left Factoring a Grammar
**Description**:  
Performs left factoring on a given grammar to remove ambiguity in production rules.

**File**: `practical3_left_factoring.c`

--->>

### ✅ Practical 4: Remove Left Recursion (Incomplete Code)
**Description**:  
Aims to remove left recursion from a given grammar.  
⚠️ **Note**: The code appears to be **incomplete**. You may need to complete or debug it before using.

**File**: `practical4_remove_left_recursion.c`

## 🖥️ How to Run the Programs

1. Make sure you have a C compiler (like GCC) installed.
2. Open your terminal/command prompt.
3. Compile the program.

📌 Note
These codes are developed for educational purposes and follow the GTU curriculum for the System Software subject. Make sure to test and validate them before use.
